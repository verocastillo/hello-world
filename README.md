# hello-world
One of my practice repositories. New to coding!

I am a recently graduated biomedical engineer, venturing 
into data science and excited to learn how to code! 

I am currently taking a Data Analytics Bootcamp by 
Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, and I'm learning how to do 
different things with my computer and learning new things.
