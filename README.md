# hello-world
One of my practice repositories. New to coding!

I am a recently graduated biomedical engineer, venturing 
into data science and excited to learn how to code! 

I am currently taking a Data Analytics Bootcamp by 
Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, and I'm learning how to do 
different things with my computer and learning new things.

For instance, I just edited this file through my computer, 
learning about new commands, in order to make editing and
coding easier. It may seem simple, but it is something
totally new to me, and I am excited that I am able to do
this!

I will be documenting my learning process and all of the 
projects I take part in through my github, so stay tuned!
